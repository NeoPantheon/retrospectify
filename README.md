## Usage

### I just want to use the app!
Just copy the files from the ``dist/`` folder to your local disk and open ``index.html`` in a modern browser. That's all to it!

Loading/Saving works using LocalStorage, so make sure the app has permission to read/write from localstorage.

### I want to build it myself from the source or contribute to the code
Then follow these instructions, depending on what you want to do

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# build for production with minification
npm run build

# build for production and view the bundle analyzer report
npm run build --report

# run unit tests
npm run unit

# run all tests
npm test
```
