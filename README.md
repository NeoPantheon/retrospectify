# retrospectify
An awesome tool for doing retrospectives digitally. [demo](http://pepf.nl/retrospective/)

## How to run
Just copy all files to your local disk and open in a modern browser, no external dependencies!
Loading/Saving works using LocalStorage, so make sure the app has permission to read/write from localstorage.
